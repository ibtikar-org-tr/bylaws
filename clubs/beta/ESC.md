## intro
- a brand new club with awesome events that aim to improve the English-speaking level of our assemblyâ€™s members by organizing physical/virtual speaking events

## Activities
### English Speaking Events
The primary objective of the English Speaking Club will be organizing English Speaking Events, which will be structured as follows:
- Members will be able to make `presentations` on any topic within `Tech` & `Economy`
- Each event will feature multiple speakers delivering presentations on various topics
- Events will also include dedicated free time for networking in English

## BETA
- Before hosting such an event, we want to try to make a small virtual version inside a small group (`BETA TESTERS`)

## Whatsapp group rules
- In the WhatsApp group, members are required to communicate exclusively in `English`. Failure to adhere to this rule will result in a warning, and repeated violations may lead to removal from the group.
